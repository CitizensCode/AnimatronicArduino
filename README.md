# Animatronic Arduino
Code for using multiple distance sensors to track an object and have a servo motor follow its location in 2D space. Eventually this will be used to control statues, and include audio dialog.

For this project I used 2 Maxbotix Ultrasonic Rangefinder (HRLV-EZ0) sensors as they had the widest field of view, while also being highly accurate and appropriate for detecting people.

**ToDo:**
 - Smooth out servo movement
 - Enable the control of multiple servos at once
